# Async

Depending on the situation, processing asynchronously can be more efficient than handling tasks synchronously. Through a simple exercise, we will explore in which situations this can be applied.

> Asynchronous processing is not always more efficient. Therefore, it should be used only where necessary and appropriate to the situation. Additionally, using asynchronous methods introduces elements beyond the developer's control, which should always be taken into consideration.
